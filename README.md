# Hybrid ABM-SD Simulation for TRD Treatment Pathway

## **🔍 Project Overview:**
This repository hosts a hybrid simulation model combining Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and System Dynamics (SD) approaches, dedicated to analyzing the Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) treatment pathway. Our model aims to provide deep insights into the complexities and dynamics of TRD treatment, assisting in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare strategies.

## **🚀 Key Features:**
- **Hybrid Modeling Approach**: Integrates ABM for individual patient trajectories and SD for broader healthcare system dynamics.
- **TRD Focused**: Specifically tailored to explore the nuances of TRD treatment pathways.
- **Data-Driven Simulations**: Utilizes real-world data to ensure accurate and reliable modeling.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Offers a suite of visualization tools for an intuitive understanding of complex dynamics.

## **🎯 Objectives:**
- To enhance understanding of TRD treatment dynamics at both individual and system levels.
- To identify key leverage points for improving TRD patient care and management.
- To support decision-making in healthcare policy and clinical practices for TRD.

## **📚 Resources and Documentation:**
We're working on detailed documentation for our software. We're also considering packaging our work so that other researchers can use it in their future projects
